# DeepSentiment

## Introduction
Sentiment classification plays a crucial role in various applications such as social media analysis and customer feedback processing. In this study, we implement three approaches for sentiment classification: multi-channel convolutional neural networks (MC-CNN), graph convolutional networks (GCN), and adaptive multi-channel GCN (AM-GCN). These models have been proposed in separate papers and have shown promising results in capturing complex patterns in text data for sentiment analysis tasks.

## Usage

Install packages

'''bash
git clone 
cd deep-sentiment
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

To run RNN and MC-CNN models:

'''bash
python main.py --model [rnn/mccnn]
'''

To run GCN/AMGCN models:
